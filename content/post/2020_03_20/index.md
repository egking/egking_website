COVID-19 is spreading in the United States. See the excellent resource at [Next Strain](https://nextstrain.org/) for an analysis of the situation. The following are some guidelines for how the lab is currently operating during this epidemic.

- *Under no circumstances* should you come to work if you are sick. This is always the case but is especially important as we try to slow the spread of COVID-19. I know we all feel our work is important and it can feel like we “can’t stay home” (I myself have been guilty of this before) but we need to do all we can to limit the spread. 

- There is currently no restriction on coming to lab. However, I encourage anyone who is able to work remotely to do so. This minimizes the risk both to those of us working remotely and to those of us that must come to the lab to maintain experiments. Ideally, we should not have more than 1 or 2 people at the lab at a time.

- If you do need to come to lab, wash your hands before and after doing any lab work. Disinfect any shared surfaces you have used.  

- If you are responsible for maintaining any experiments and you become ill, become aware of exposure, or are concerned about an increased risk to yourself or someone you have regular contact with, do not come to the lab and please communicate with the lab so we can cover your lab work. I know we are all committed to helping each other through this. Please ask for help before trying to take care of labwork yourself if any of these things are true for you.

- In the event that we need to move to stricter restrictions on person-to-person contact, we will set up a google sheet with a schedule of critical lab tasks to make sure we maintain our animals. I will let you know if this needs to happen. 

- Working remotely will be challenging for some of us, especially those of us with kids at home. Let's keep checking in with each other via Slack and Zoom and try to set realistic goals for what we can accomplish on our research during this time. 

- I hope we all feel we can talk openly about this and how it might impact us or our work. Let's support each other, remain flexible in our plans, and to be ready for changes to the situation. Remember, prepare, don’t panic.
