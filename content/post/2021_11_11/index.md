Many of our lab members have had exciting news over the last year but I have not been keeping up with updating our lab news page. I could not be more proud of all of the amazing things they have accomplished, especially during a global pandemic. Some major highlights include:

- [Elizabeth Jones](/authors/aejones/) started in a PhD program at the University of Kansas Medical Center!

- [Ronel Ghidey](/authors/c1ghidey/) graduated from MU and started in a Masters of Public Health program at Johns Hopkins University!

- [Mathanghi Ganesan](/authors/b4ganesan/) graduated from MU and started in a PhD program in translational neuroscience at Phillips Universit√§t!

- [Andrew Jones](/authors/c2jones/) graduated from MU and started as a medical student at the University of Kansas!

- [Jordyn Moaton](/authors/c3jones/) graduated from MU and secured a position at Boone Hospital. She will be on her way to Medical School next year!

- [Dr. Patricka Williams-Simon](/authors/b2williamssimon/) successfully defended her PhD research on the genetic basis of learning, memory, and thermal tolerance. She secured a highly competitive NSF postdoctoral fellowship and has started a post-doc position with Paul Schmidt at the University of Pennsylvania! 

- [Dr. Enoch Ng'oma](/authors/angoma/) has been hired as a tenure-track faculty member at the Univerisity of Missouri! He is setting up his own lab and will be working on aging in fish and fly systems.
