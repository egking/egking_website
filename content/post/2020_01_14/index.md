Our paper, led by Patricka Williams-Simon and Mathangi Ganesan will soon be part of a special issue to honor the legacy of Troy Zars in the Journal of Neurogenetics. We are honored to have this forum to talk about the many lessons we learned working with Troy, some about the genetics of learning and memory and others about life.
