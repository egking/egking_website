### About Me

I am a postdoctoral scholar currently in Dr. Elizabeth G. King's Lab at the University of Missouri in the Division of Biological Sciences. My research focuses on the genetic architectures of life history diversity and evolution in insect and fish models. I integrate genetic and genomic approaches to understand genomic level responses to selection, and how these changes link to organismal attributes, including reproduction and longevity. Prior to this position, I worked under Dr. Alessandro Cellerino at Fritz Lipmann Institute for Aging in Jena, Germany on genetic architectures of morphological and aging-related phenotypes in a new fish model where I also received my PhD from Friedrich-Schiller University - Jena. I earned my MSc. at University of Oslo Natural History Museum under the mentorship of Dr. Brita Stedje where I investigated genetic diversity in the African pencil cedar, Juniperus procera in east Africa. I am a citizen of Malawi where also I received my bachelor's degree in biological education.
