### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biological Sciences](https://biology.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri. Before joining the faculty at Mizzou in 2014, I was a postdoctoral scholar in [Tony Long's lab](http://wfitch.bio.uci.edu/~tdlong/sandvox/) at [UC Irvine](https://ecoevo.bio.uci.edu/) where I first started working on the [DSPR](http://wfitch.bio.uci.edu/~dspr/).  Further back in time, I was an undergraduate at [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) and then a PhD student working on wing dimorphic insects with [Daphne Fairbairn](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/daphnef) and [Derek Roff](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/derekr) at [UC Riverside](https://eeob.ucr.edu/).
