DataPhiles is a community for those who love data. Email Dr. King to request to be added to the mailing list: [kingeg@missouri.edu](mailto:kingeg@missouri.edu)

### General Format

DataPhiles is an opportunity to discuss practical issues surrounding analyzing data in an informal, low pressure forum. Each week, a volunteer will bring a data set, give a short presentation (8-12 minutes) outlining the basic biology/natural history of their system, giving a general description of their questions (why/what they want out of the data), perhaps presenting a few preliminary and/or graphical results on the data (graphical presentations of the data are strongly encouraged), and a description of the statistical techniques they've used or are thinking of using, or particular problems they're having with the analysis. The floor is then open for general question & answer/discussion. Email a one- or two-sentence blurb about your topic to volunteer to present: [kingeg@missouri.edu](mailto:kingeg@missouri.edu)

The last DataPhiles of each month will be an open Q & A format where anyone can bring any questions they have about data analysis. 

### MU R Users Slack Group

If you are interested in DataPhiles, then consider joining MU R Users slack group. We hope this will be a place where people can ask questions and help each other out. We are trying to build a self-sustaining community of R people across disciplines. [Join the Slack group here](https://join.slack.com/t/r-musers-group/shared_invite/zt-d0cfjxys-QTfy4wF~0cOHu9PH0xZ5mg) or email for more information: [kingeg@missouri.edu](mailto:kingeg@missouri.edu).
