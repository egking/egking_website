DataPhiles is a community for those who love data. Email Dr. King to request to be added to the mailing list: [kingeg@missouri.edu](mailto:kingeg@missouri.edu)

### General Format

DataPhiles is an opportunity to discuss practical issues surrounding analyzing data in an informal, low pressure forum. Each week, a volunteer will bring a data set, give a short presentation (8-12 minutes) outlining the basic biology/natural history of their system, giving a general description of their questions (why/what they want out of the data), perhaps presenting a few preliminary and/or graphical results on the data (graphical presentations of the data are strongly encouraged), and a description of the statistical techniques they've used or are thinking of using, or particular problems they're having with the analysis. The floor is then open for general question & answer/discussion. Email a one- or two-sentence blurb about your topic to volunteer to present: [kingeg@missouri.edu](mailto:kingeg@missouri.edu)
